ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe (CLI Version in Python)
This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python for two players. The game logic is designed with clean structure, using Python's core features like loops, functions, error handling, and list manipulations.

ðŸ§  Features
Two-player mode: Alternates between Player 1 and Player 2.

Dynamic game board display after each move.

Win detection for:

Horizontal wins (--)

Vertical wins (|)

Diagonal wins (\\, /)

Input validation to prevent overwriting existing moves.

Replay option at the end of each game.

Clean and minimalistic terminal-based interface.

ðŸ›  How It Works
The game starts with a 3x3 board filled with zeros (0) indicating empty spots.

Players take turns to input their move (row and column).

The board updates with the playerâ€™s number (1 or 2) in the selected spot.

After each move, the game checks for a win condition.

If a player wins, the game announces the winner and offers to play again.

Invalid inputs (like selecting a filled cell) prompt the user to try again.
